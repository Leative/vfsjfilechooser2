**vfsjfilechooser2** is a mavenized fork of the dormant [vfsjfilechooser project](http://vfsjfilechooser.sourceforge.net/) on sf.net.

It is an alternative to Java's [JFileChooser](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/filechooser.html) Swing component, which does not suffer from the JFileChooser's infamous "freezes" on [Windows](http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6372808).

It has been updated to work with version 2.0 of the [VFS Apache commons](http://commons.apache.org/vfs/) and includes a few bugfixes and enhancements.
